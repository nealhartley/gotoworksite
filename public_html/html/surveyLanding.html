                57,000 people are currently receiving a
                health related benefit due to the impact their mental health condition has on
                their ability to work. Mental health conditions have accounted for 97% of the
                growth in health-related benefits in the last 10 years, and this is part of an
                international trend where people diagnosed with mental health conditions often have
                poor employment outcomes.
                <br><br>
                There are a number of barriers that are preventing 
                people from finding and keeping a job. We want to know what these barriers are
                and we want to discover a way to break through them. This is where you come in,
                please take our survey and offer us insight into how mental health affects all of New Zealand.</p>
