            <p class = "survey_text"> Team Path Starters are working through the R9 Accelerator as part of a better 
                of business initiative. Their mission is to provide fulfilling employment for 
                those who are stuck on their journey.  57,000 people are currently receiving
                health related benefit due to the impact their mental health condition has on
                their ability to work. Mental health conditions have accounted for 97% of the
                growth in health-related benefits in the last 10 years, and this is part of an
                international trend.People diagnosed with mental health conditions often have
                poor employment outcomes. There are a number of barriers that are preventing 
                people from finding and keeping a job. We want to know what these barriers are
                and we want to discover a way to break through them. This is where you come in,
                please take our survey and offer us insight into how mental health affects all of New Zealand</p>
