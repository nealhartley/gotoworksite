                <p>Over 57,000 of Ministry of Social Development’s clients currently receive a benefit due to the impact
                    their mental health condition has on their ability to work. Mental health conditions have accounted
                    for 97% of the growth in health related benefits in the last 10 years, and this is part of an 
                    international trend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People with mental health conditions often have poor employment outcomes.
                    There are a number of barriers that prevent them from finding and keeping a job. 
                    We know that appropriate work, combined with the right support, is good for people’s mental health
                    and people with mental health conditions can and want to work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This opportunity is about improving employment outcomes for people with common
                    mental health conditions so they can help themselves to be safe, strong, healthy and independent.

                R9 Accelerator is one of the first large scale GovTech accelerators in the world.
                A radical evolution in the way government solves problems, R9 Accelerator makes it easier
                and faster to solve major customer pain points in a low risk, low cost, yet innovative way.
                R9 Accelerator aims to find scalable, repeatable solutions to customer pain points,
                which can be delivered by sustainable organisations. This delivers triple benefits
                to the New Zealand economy by using capital to solve customer pain points,
                improving customer’s satisfaction rates and delivering efficiencies for government
                operations.

               “Go to work on mental health” have been awarded a place on the R9 Accelerator programme.
               At the R9 “RevUp” weekend, they formed a team of innovators,
               designers and developers with wide-ranging skills, knowledge and sector connections. 
               The team will work together to achieve a common goal, 
               to improve the employment outcomes for people with common mental health conditions.

                     The first week of R9 Accelerator 3.0 draws to close. 
                     This week was ‘Bootcamp’, a jam-packed week of workshops, 
                     sessions and team building exercises, to prime the R9 ‘cohort’ 
                     with the tools and methodologies necessary to carry us forward.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     We have learnt a lot this week.  
                     Highlights include a presentation by a ‘Gov Tech’ guru,
                     who spoke to us live from Austin Texas, 
                     and inspirational talks on subject matter such as exponential technology, 
                     lean start up and market validation.   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     There was also content we already knew well, 
                     such as Agile, Lean, design thinking, wellness and resilience. 
                     However, with such a wide range of stakeholders, 
                     with different levels of skills and experience,  
                     it is no surprise Creative HQ took such a uniform approach.     
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    What really stood out to me this week is our team.  
                    Teamwork is the most important contributor to success in this programme, 
                    and we are getting on ridiculously well!  
                    We have a quiet confidence about us, 
                    because with our breadth of knowledge, and range of skills, 
                    we have the potential to go far in this programme.
